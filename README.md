# customers-app-react-redux

This is an ABM project with React using React-Routing, Redux-Actions, Redux-Promises and Redux-Forms. 
For the remote server I used Json Server to have a server with remote data for the project(check the db.json 
for check the infromation).

Inside the project you can check implementations for the concept of High Order Components, Actions creators,
reducers and component not controlled, also it's neccesary have knowledge of REST Api to understand this ABM example.

The example it based on the Udemy Course called: React JS + Redux + ES6. Completo ¡De 0 a experto! (español)
